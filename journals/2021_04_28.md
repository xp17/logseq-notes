> Author here, thanks for the posting! I've been working it since February, it started as an org-mode web outliner so that I can use it on my phone to check some todos and capture some ideas.
> I added some features (backlinks, graph, block embeds, etc.) from Roam Research after trying it. It can be self-hosted and the plan is to have something like TiddlyWiki so that you can use it as a whole HTML file in your own website. The documentation is a read-only version of logseq itself and it's hosted on GitHub pages.

The org mode parser is open sourced too, https://github.com/mldoc/mldoc, most features are already supported, we're working on something like org agenda and org-roam integrations.

Documentation example: https://logseq.github.io/. Any questions or feedback will be appreciated, thank you!
